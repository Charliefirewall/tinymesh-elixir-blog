# Introduction


<a name="whats-the-plan"></a>

## What's the plan?
A weekly post on what I learn. As a personal repository of things I learn over the years to come.

<a name="the-inspiration"></a>

## The Inspiration

Originally taken from Bernheisel's blog. See [Original Github](https://github.com/dbernheisel/bernheisel.com).
Reasons I like this is
1. because one can track how many users are reading the blog currently.
2. Elixir is something I wish to spend more of time with and contirbute to.

## About me

I have a couple of years of experience in web development. Prior to that, I have a master's thesis in nature inspired computing in material science.

Here is the list: 

1. Angular 13.2 
2. Python - fastapi for hosting a ML model (background image removal based on the popular u2net.)
3. Python - scripting, webscraping.
4. MATLAB - for Multi Objective Optimisation of Neural Networks using Genetic Algorithms. 
   1. I used predator-prey model but there are other interetsting approaches in field of nature inspired computing. e.g. Particle swarm optimistaion, etc.
5. Bash - for automating things I don't want to do. 

Till next post...
